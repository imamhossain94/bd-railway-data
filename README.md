## 📊 Dataset Overview

### `railway-data.json`

- **20 intercity trains** across Bangladesh
- Each train entry includes:
  - `code` — Official BR train number (e.g. `"725"`)
  - `name` — Bilingual name (`en` / `bn`)
  - `type` — Train type (currently `"Intercity"`)
  - `origin` / `destination` — Station code + bilingual name
  - `departureTime` / `arrivalTime` — 24-hour format (`"HH:MM"`)
  - `offDay` — Weekly off day with bilingual label
  - `classes` — Array of seat classes available on this train
  - `stoppages` — Ordered array of stops with:
    - `stationCode` — References a station in `railway-stations.json`
    - `arrivalTime` / `departureTime` — 24-hour format
    - `haltMinutes` — Dwell time in minutes
    - `distanceKm` — Cumulative distance from origin
  - `fares` — Object mapping destination station codes to per-class fares (BDT)

### `railway-stations.json`

- **108 stations** across Bangladesh
- Each station entry includes:
  - `code` — Short unique identifier (e.g. `"DA"`, `"KLN"`)
  - `name` — Bilingual (`en` / `bn`)
  - `district` / `division` — Administrative area (bilingual)
  - `lat` / `lng` — GPS coordinates
  - `zone` — Railway zone (`"East"` or `"West"`)
  - `isMajorJunction` *(optional)* — `true` if this is a major junction station

> **Coverage note:** 108 stations are defined in total, of which 57 are actively referenced by the 20 trains in `railway-data.json`. The remaining 51 stations are pre-included for future train data expansion.

## 🔗 Data Schema (TypeScript)

```ts
interface Train {
  code: string;
  name: { en: string; bn: string };
  type: "Intercity";
  origin: { code: string; name: { en: string; bn: string } };
  destination: { code: string; name: { en: string; bn: string } };
  departureTime: string; // "HH:MM"
  arrivalTime: string;   // "HH:MM"
  offDay: { en: string; bn: string };
  classes: Array<"shovon" | "shovon_chair" | "snigdha" | "ac_seat" | "ac_berth">;
  stoppages: Stoppage[];
  fares: Record<string, Record<string, number>>; // stationCode → class → BDT
}

interface Stoppage {
  stationCode: string;
  arrivalTime: string;   // "HH:MM"
  departureTime: string; // "HH:MM"
  haltMinutes: number;
  distanceKm: number;    // cumulative from origin
}

interface Station {
  code: string;
  name: { en: string; bn: string };
  district: { en: string; bn: string };
  division: { en: string; bn: string };
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
  zone: "East" | "West";
  isMajorJunction?: boolean;
}
```

## ✅ Data Validation

This dataset has been programmatically verified:

- ✅ **0 undefined station references** — all `stationCode` values in stoppages/fares resolve to a defined station
- ✅ **0 duplicate train codes**
- ✅ **0 stations missing coordinates** — all 108 stations have valid `lat`/`lng`
- ✅ **Distances are non-decreasing** — all stoppage `distanceKm` values are in correct ascending order
- ℹ️ **51 stations pre-defined but unused** — included for future expansion (additional trains to be added)
- ℹ️ **Partial fare coverage** — only key major-stop fares are listed, mirroring official BR ticketing

## 📝 Usage Example

```js
const trains = require('./railway-data.json').trains;
const stations = require('./railway-stations.json');

// Build a lookup map
const stationMap = Object.fromEntries(stations.map(s => [s.code, s]));

// Find Dhaka → Khulna trains
const dhakaToKhulna = trains.filter(
  t => t.origin.code === 'DA' && t.destination.code === 'KLN'
);

dhakaToKhulna.forEach(t => {
  const fare = t.fares['KLN']?.shovon;
  console.log(`${t.name.en} (#${t.code}): departs ${t.departureTime}, Shovon fare: ৳${fare}`);
});
```
